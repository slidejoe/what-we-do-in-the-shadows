# How do web components relate to Umbraco?
- <mdi-hand-okay /> Belissima!
  - <mdi-umbraco /> The backoffice is built with web components and the UUI web component library
  - <mdi-package-variant-closed-plus /> You can use UUI in Umbraco and outside Umbraco
- <mdi-recycle /> Reuse of markup in the frontend and backoffice
