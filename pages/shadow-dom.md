# Shadow DOM

- The Shadow DOM is a critical concept in web components, providing encapsulation.
- It enables the creation of isolated DOM subtrees within an element, preventing CSS and JavaScript conflicts.
- Encapsulation ensures that the styling and functionality of a component do not affect or get affected by the surrounding page.
- It's a fundamental feature for building robust and modular web components.
