# Joe

- Web components are a set of web platform APIs that enable the creation of custom, reusable HTML elements.
- They encapsulate both the structure and behaviour of these elements.
- 4 main techs:
  - Custom Elements - define custom elements and their behaviour - what we think of as "web components"
  - Shadow DOM - used to encapsulate styles and markup - more on this later
  - HTML templates - `<template>` and `<slot>` elements - write templates that are not directly rendered on the page. Reusable
  - JS Modules - encapsulation of scripts
