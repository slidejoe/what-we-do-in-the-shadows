# Shadow DOM

- DOM Encapsulation.
- Style/CSS Encapsulation.
- It's *just* HTML elements... 

Consider:

```html
<input type="color">
```
<input type="color">

```html
<uui-color-picker/>
```
<ColourPicker/>

- Inspiration for title
- It enables the creation of isolated DOM subtrees within an element, preventing CSS conflicts.
- Encapsulation ensures that styling and functionality of a component do not affect or get affected by the surrounding page.
- It's a fundamental feature for building robust and modular web components.

Just an HTML tag...
